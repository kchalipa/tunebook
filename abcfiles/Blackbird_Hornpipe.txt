T: Blackbird Hornpipe
C: Trad.
R: reel
Z: Cam Cross 
S: Amanda Kerr
N: Another new tune for me.  Seems to have a lot in common with The Blackbird (set dance?), 
N: with its repeated landing on the open D, but is also recognizably distinct. Still figuring out
N: chords and fine-tuning the arrangement.
M: 4/4
K: D
