T: The Twenty-Eighth of January
C: Trad.
R: reel
M: 4/4
S: KY Contra Tunes and thesession.org/tunes/15717 for the base
Z: Cam Cross
N: Now this is an interesting number! The B-part follows a pretty standard I/VIIb progression
N: found in many Celtic tunes, but the A-part uses the "Dorian vamp," pretty unusual in fiddle tunes
N: but a staple in classic rock. For that reason, I think it's perhaps a more "jammy" tune than a melodic
N: one; and one version I looked at had a G-F-Em-Am windup that gave it a little more of a bluesy
N: punch. The top 4 bars are the tune in its base form, and the bottom 4 bars illustrate how I imagine
N: the tune in a jam setting.
K: Ador
