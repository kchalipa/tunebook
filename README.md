# CLC-Tunebook
A curated fiddle tune collection

## About
This is a small and perpetually unfinished project in which I will be collecting and transcribing my favorite fiddle tunes using Michael Eskin's [ABC Transcription Tools](https://michaeleskin.com/abctools/abctools.html).  I try to keep it simple but to arrange the tunes and chordings to capture the main elements that I like.  The goal is to be able to pull this up on the go for a quick practice list or to share with friends.  Feel free to grab whatever tunes you like from this collection.
