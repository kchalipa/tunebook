# CLC-Tunebook

A small fiddle tune collection, curated by Cameron Lindley Cross (CLC).

## About

This is a small and perpetually unfinished project in which I will be collecting and transcribing my favorite fiddle tunes using Michael Eskin's [ABC Transcription Tools](https://michaeleskin.com/abctools/abctools.html).  My aim is to keep the tunes stripped down to their fundamental elements, so they are easy to read and don't take up more than one page per tune, but to include choice variations that I find generative.  All are welcome to grab tunes from the source files below -- written in [ABC notation](https://abcnotation.com/) but saved as `.txt` files for simplicity -- and adapt them to their own needs, or to simply use the site to learn some new tunes!

## Contents

This GitHub repository contains the following files:

- `abcfiles-clc`: The ABC source files that go into the library
- `abcfiles-djn`: My uncle's ABC source files -- there for my reference, but not included in the tunebook
- `cat-tunebook.txt`: The script I run to concatenate all my source files into a single file
- `clc-tunebook.txt`: The output of the above script

On significant updates, I run the `clc-tunebook` through the HTML generator on Michael Eskin's site and place the output in the `docs` directory, where it can be loaded as a webpage.
